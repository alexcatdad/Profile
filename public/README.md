# Public Assets

This directory contains static assets served from the root URL path.

## PWA Icons

To generate the required PNG icon files:

1. Open `../scripts/generate-icons.html` in a web browser
2. Click the download buttons to save:
   - `icon-192.png` (192x192)
   - `icon-512.png` (512x512)
   - `apple-icon.png` (180x180)
3. Save these files to this directory

The `icon.svg` file serves as a fallback and can be used directly by modern browsers.

## Manifest

The `manifest.webmanifest` file enables Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality, allowing users to install the site on their devices.

## Favicon

The `favicon.ico` file is served as the browser tab icon.
